# Word 2007/2010 Redaction Tool
{project:description}
# Overview
The Word 2007/2010 Redaction tool works by allowing users to redact a document using a two stage process:
* First, regions of text which should be redacted are marked within the document.
* Second, the marked document is redacted, and all marked text is replaced.
# Details
The add-in adds a Redact group to Word's Review tab:

* *Unmark* removes all redaction marks from the selected range
* *Next* moves the selection to the next redaction mark in the document (useful to see what content is marked)
* *Previous* moves the selection to the previous redaction mark in the document
